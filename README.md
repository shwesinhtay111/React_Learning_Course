Class,Module

Standard Library - collection of required function, build in function

Third party - not writtern by own, not starndard library of language

Main parts to learn language - Syntax,Symatic,Pragmatic

JavaScript - Inpretative and Functional Programming need to know

Pragmatic effectively to use- Api, Library,Framework need to know

API - same as restAPI, Language Library Functionality

Set - use to remove duplicated values

Map - mainly use in the case where get value by key

Stack 
      - save reference,make only push and pop 

      - fuction call time save primitive to slack

      - after function call time pop primitive from slack

Heap -save actual object

Garbage occur - garbage occurs in heap

Garbage - not usable in memory called garbage, not usable value having

Garbage Collection - remove unusabel object in heap

WeakMap and WeakSet - To avoid garbage collect instead of using map and set

Weak Reference -key in WeakMap and WeakSet

Size in dynamic variable - biggest size alocated 8 bytes

Typed Array(Uint8Array,Int32Array,etc.) - size in dynamic variable to adjust memory and cpu -Optimizing

Buffer - can use typed array and use same memory location

Standard Library

Little endian and big endian -c++ little endian , java big endian

DataView -use to solve between little endian and big endian,not use in daily programming

Pattern Matching(regular expression) - use in daily programming,use in web scraping

web scraping - use from other side data to own, is leagal? from robot of their side can see allow or not
